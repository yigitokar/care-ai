## Taking Photos Quickly

<Steps>

### Step 1
Turn the camera on using the ON/OFF switch and rotate the auto mode selector lever to `AUTO`.

### Step 2 
Use the rear command dial or front command dial to choose a scene mode that matches your subject from the options displayed on the LCD.

### Step 3
Frame your shot using the viewfinder or LCD monitor and press the shutter button halfway to focus.

### Step 4
When focus is confirmed by the green focus frame, press the shutter button the rest of the way down to take the picture.

The camera will analyze the scene and pick optimal settings like shutter speed, aperture, white balance and more. This AUTO mode is great for quick snapshots with no fuss.

For more control over exposure and access to the full range of camera features, switch to [Program AE (P)](/advanced-photography/shooting-modes), Aperture Priority (A), Shutter Priority (S) or full Manual (M) shooting modes.
